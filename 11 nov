Study on binary search tree

A Binary Search Tree or BST as it is popularly called is a binary tree that fulfills the following conditions:

The nodes that are lesser than the root node which is placed as left children of the BST.
The nodes that are greater than the root node that is placed as the right children of the BST.
The left and right subtrees are in turn the binary search trees.
This arrangement of ordering the keys in a particular sequence facilitates the programmer to carry out operations like searching, inserting, deleting, etc.
If the nodes are not ordered, then we might have to compare each and every node before we can get the operation result.
