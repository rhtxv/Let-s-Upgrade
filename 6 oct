The C++ for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop than while or do-while loops.

The C++ for loop is same as C/C#. We can initialize variable, check condition and increment/decrement value.

for(initialization; condition; incr/decr){    
//code to be executed    
}    


C++ For Loop Example
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main() {  
         for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){      
            cout<<i <<"\n";      
          }       
    }
